# Medical-Appointment-No-Shows-Data-Investigation
Doing independent data analysis project investigating Medical Appointment No Shows data set (on Kaggle)
Data set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/discussion/38330#latest-288579

With this project I am going to create some defined functions to more efficiently re-use code in the future to analyze data.

So far I have only implemented a PCA logistic regression model which only has an accuracy of 79% which is not as good as I would like.  I figure there are better models to use than Logistic Regression.
